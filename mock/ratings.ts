            "Thank you very much for this course! I would say that for beginners, it is a nice course. However, when it gets to functions and class methods, it feels more difficult than before. It would be nice to have more lectures to practice functions.\n\nAlso, the whole section about PDFs is outdated because Python 3 has changed the names of code elements. Of course, you can read all these updated names in Jupyter, but it would be nice to have fresh lectures for those enrolling in the course.\n\nIn general, I feel really inspired by the knowledge I gained, and I would be happy to discover other lectures by Jose Marcial Portilla. The style of the lectures and the homework were well elaborated and interesting to perform. The entire course, which is described as 22 hours long, took me 20 days and 70.75 hours to complete. I took it very seriously and marked all my lessons in my personal schedule.\n\nAfter this course, I feel inspired and ready to test all the knowledge I gained in practice. I hope I'll find efficient ways to do so! Thank you very much for this course!",

            "TLDR: More \"Zero\" than \"Hero\" - This course would be better described as \"An Introduction to Programming with Python\".\n-- You absolutely will NOT be able to get a job as a Python Developer after just this course!\n-- You absolutely WILL have to teach yourself a LOT more to take anything this course touches on further!\n\nLet me start by stating that I already had a fairly good understanding of programming concepts, design patterns and paradigms having done Full-Stack Web Development with PHP. However that was many years ago now and I wanted an introduction to Python, even if it meant starting with the basics, hoping to advance fairly quickly.\n\nHaving now completed this course I would say that it was just that - i.e. \"a good introduction\". The content was generally well presented and easy to follow. Using Jupyter Notebooks is a nice teaching method and easy for beginners as an introduction, but it doesn't represent a real-world approach to development so... if the course ever reached more advanced level I feel it should have switched to a Text/Code editor and native Python execution.\n\nThat however is the problem, the course never really gets that advanced. It manages to cover the basics well, and it does plot a course through more progressive topics: introducing more advanced programming ideas and concepts, use-cases, external libraries and examples ... BUT only at the most basic level.\n\nIt's like having a whirlwind tour of a Grand Hotel by being rushed around every room on the ground floor where you only get to glimpse in to each room from the doorway.\n\nIn all fairness this course (using the Hotel metaphor) gives you the keys to all those rooms, but it's very much up to YOU in your own time to really take the time to go in to each 'room' (or just the ones of interest) and look around for yourself -- i.e. you will very much have to take the basic introduction provided by this course and TEACH YOURSELF how to actually take any of it to a level which will be useful or desirable to an Employer!\n\nI enjoyed the course, the pacing felt good and it felt like making progress. The projects were suitably fun and challenging to cover the concepts along the way, that is UNTIL the \"final project\" which [spoiler alert] there isn't one! At least not a prescribed one that you can get help with from structured and progressive tutorials as you go (like earlier in the course). Nope, instead it's just \"Here's a list of 100 possible projects and it's up to you to pick one and do it all on your own ... that's me done, end of the course ... see ya!\" -- this was, to say the least, rather a disappointment. Especially given how well the course structured up to this point. It just ends abruptly, with no support to complete or judge your final project.\n\nIt was only after some time considering my options and re-evaluating what I felt that I got from this course, and where it left me in terms of progress towards becoming an employable Python Developer that I saw this course for what it is (all catchy headlines aside). It is a BASIC introduction to programming and the Python language, and that is all. I have already sourced another course to take my Python learning further.\n\nI don't regret taking this course, but I do feel that it does NOT come as advertised! -- If you want a good introduction course then do consider this one, but understand it's limitations and (perhaps) only buy it when it's on offer!  ;D",

            "<p>TLDR: More \"Zero\" than \"Hero\" - This course would be better described as \"An Introduction to Programming with Python\".<br>-- You absolutely will NOT be able to get a job as a Python Developer after just this course!<br>-- You absolutely WILL have to teach yourself a LOT more to take anything this course touches on further!</p>\n\n<p>Let me start by stating that I already had a fairly good understanding of programming concepts, design patterns and paradigms having done Full-Stack Web Development with PHP. However that was many years ago now and I wanted an introduction to Python, even if it meant starting with the basics, hoping to advance fairly quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Having now completed this course I would say that it was just that - i.e. \"a good introduction\". The content was generally well presented and easy to follow. Using Jupyter Notebooks is a nice teaching method and easy for beginners as an introduction, but it doesn't represent a real-world approach to development so... if the course ever reached more advanced level I feel it should have switched to a Text/Code editor and native Python execution.</p>\n\n<p>That however is the problem, the course never really gets that advanced. It manages to cover the basics well, and it does plot a course through more progressive topics: introducing more advanced programming ideas and concepts, use-cases, external libraries and examples ... BUT only at the most basic level.</p>\n\n<p>It's like having a whirlwind tour of a Grand Hotel by being rushed around every room on the ground floor where you only get to glimpse in to each room from the doorway.</p>\n\n<p>In all fairness this course (using the Hotel metaphor) gives you the keys to all those rooms, but it's very much up to YOU in your own time to really take the time to go in to each 'room' (or just the ones of interest) and look around for yourself -- i.e. you will very much have to take the basic introduction provided by this course and TEACH YOURSELF how to actually take any of it to a level which will be useful or desirable to an Employer!</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed the course, the pacing felt good and it felt like making progress. The projects were suitably fun and challenging to cover the concepts along the way, that is UNTIL the \"final project\" which [spoiler alert] there isn't one! At least not a prescribed one that you can get help with from structured and progressive tutorials as you go (like earlier in the course). Nope, instead it's just \"Here's a list of 100 possible projects and it's up to you to pick one and do it all on your own ... that's me done, end of the course ... see ya!\" -- this was, to say the least, rather a disappointment. Especially given how well the course structured up to this point. It just ends abruptly, with no support to complete or judge your final project.</p>\n\n<p>It was only after some time considering my options and re-evaluating what I felt that I got from this course, and where it left me in terms of progress towards becoming an employable Python Developer that I saw this course for what it is (all catchy headlines aside). It is a BASIC introduction to programming and the Python language, and that is all. I have already sourced another course to take my Python learning further.</p>\n\n<p>I don't regret taking this course, but I do feel that it does NOT come as advertised! -- If you want a good introduction course then do consider this one, but understand it's limitations and (perhaps) only buy it when it's on offer!  ;D</p>",
